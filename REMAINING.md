# Remaining work (truthful tracker — done items stay listed as done)

## Done this pass (shipped, tested, in main)

- Session presets + Flowtime + remembered choice; distraction parking (D +
  park button); visible desktop task pill; weekly goal card.
- Streak Shield auto-apply + `streak_history` audit + `shieldUsed` plumbing.
- Deep Sea + Study Room full scenes (Full-tier, lazy, Pro-gated).
- Blog + Article schema; `/pomodoro-timer-for/:exam` funnels; per-user OG;
  live focusing-now counter.
- Stripe env-gated scaffolding + /premium card UI; weekly recap API + card +
  email; referral `?ref=` auto-apply.
- Plausible + Sentry (both env-gated); ESLint strict + changed-files CI
  gate; knip files+deps CI gate; Playwright matrix projects + 10 green
  timer-survival e2e; PiP mini-timer; print stylesheet; locale formatting
  foundations; `.browserslistrc`; qs/fflate override pins; single drizzle
  snapshot; dead-code/dependency removals.

## Still needs an explicit owner decision (not started on purpose)

- [decision] **Next.js migration.** Recommended: stay on Vite + Express
  (prerender covers SEO; rewrite risks the P0 retention paths).
- [decision] **Supabase + RLS.** App-side ownership + contract tests hold.
- [decision] **Stripe pricing/launch.** Infra ships dormant until keys +
  prices + tax/refund ops are decided. Free AI-chat quota rides with it.
- [decision] **Full UI translation (hi/es/pt/id/ar + RTL).** No
  machine-translated user strings ship without native review; locale
  formatting foundations are in.

## Engineered backlog (no decision needed, ordered)

1. Full Dexie offline-first sync (`/sync/push|pull`, conflict policy).
2. Constellation + Zen Garden scenes (stubs with Pro gating ship now).
3. Design-token lint (one accent, radii, shadow, weights) + copy pass.
4. Hreflang stub; exam URL canonicalization review after funnel indexing.
5. Phase 9 remainder: task drag-reorder + estimates, exam-mode planner,
   class/school codes, extension (MV3), calendar/imports, desktop/mobile
   wrappers, voice check-in, flashcard breaks, teams.
6. Device lab: BrowserStack real-device videos for the Playwright matrix;
   200% zoom + RTL manual passes.
7. Legacy differential bundle (measure `device_context` tiers first).
8. Knip export-level tuning (currently files+deps gated; 209 export flags
   are mostly router-registration false positives).
9. ESLint legacy backlog (changed-files gated; full-repo still red).
10. Streak endangerment nudges on user-local timing; push-subscription
    sweeper; missed-day nudge scheduling.
11. Dependabot 41: prod-surface pins applied (qs/fflate); remainder is
    dev/transitive — triage in CI where network is reliable.
12. `streak_history` backfill for pre-table completions (table writes from
    this release forward).

## Ops checklist (manual, each deploy)

- Vercel primary domain = apex (see docs/DEPLOYMENT.md).
- Stripe webhook registered (`/api/stripe/webhook`,
  `checkout.session.completed`) when enabling cards.
- Sentry DSN + Plausible domain set when enabling observability.
- Resend key + EMAIL_FROM for recap/retention emails.
